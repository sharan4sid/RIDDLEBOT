## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Riddle Generation**: Leverages Google's generative AI via Genkit to create unique riddles on demand.
- **Interactive Riddle Solver**: Guess the answer, get hints, and see how many tries you have left.
- **AI Chatbot Assistant**: Chat with a bot to change the riddle's difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) or topic (e.g., `animals`, `science`, `history`).
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Theming**: Switch between beautiful, custom-designed Light (Soft Sky) and Dark (Nocturne Bloom) modes.
- **Context-Aware**: The app uses React Context to manage the state of riddle constraints across different components.
